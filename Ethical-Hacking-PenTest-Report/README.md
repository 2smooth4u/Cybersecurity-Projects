# üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Hacking Penetration Test Report 

## üßæ Introduction

The test environment consisted of **five vulnerable machines**, each emulating a real-world system or service. The machines were interconnected in a controlled internal network and accessible only through the assigned tester's virtual lab setup. The penetration test aimed to evaluate their **security posture**, simulate real-world exploits, and provide detailed remediation strategies. All testing was performed out-of-hours and without user interaction, as per the assignment scope.

### üñ•Ô∏è Machines Overview

| Machine Name    | Description                                 | Target Services              |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `Machine 1`     | Linux server running vulnerable SSH, Samba  | OpenSSH, SMB, NetBIOS        |
| `Machine 2`     | Web server with outdated CMS & PHP backend  | HTTP (Apache/Nginx), PHP     |
| `Machine 3`     | Windows system with misconfigured access    | SMB, RDP                     |
| `Machine 4`     | Database server with weak credentials       | MySQL/MariaDB, FTP           |
| `Machine 5`     | Multi-service box for pivoting & privilege  | SSH, NFS, Apache, cron tasks |

The engagement followed a structured methodology: **reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting**. Each machine was tested independently and as part of the overall network to identify opportunities for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data extraction.


## üéØ Project Scope

The task was to perform an authorized penetration test on a simulated enterprise environment representing **NewBizz Ltd**, consisting of five virtual machines.

### üîç Activities Performed:
- Infrastructure & web application vulnerability assessment
- Exploitation of identified weaknesses (RCE, privilege escalation, SQLi, etc.)
- Post-exploitation analysis
- Risk evaluation and mitigation
- Reporting with evidence, screenshots, and references

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **Nmap**, **Nikto**, **Burp Suite**, **Metasploit**, **Hydra**
- **Kali Linux**, **Gobuster**, **SQLmap**, **Enum4linux**
- Manual testing (payload crafting, enumeration, privilege escalation)

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Evaluation of security configurations of network/endpoint systems
- Use of professional tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities
- Evidence-backed risk assessment and mitigations
- Structured technical reporting in line with industry practice
