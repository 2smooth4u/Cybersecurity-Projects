## 🧠 Project Overview

The client is a UK-based defence-sector enterprise vulnerable to sabotage, espionage, and APTs. My role was to evaluate and design a proactive cyber defence architecture meeting the following goals:

- 🔍 Detect insider reconnaissance and lateral movement
- 🧰 Recommend sensor deployment, tools, and scalable data collection
- ⚙️ Evaluate SIEM platforms (Splunk vs Elastic)
- 📈 Justify cost of implementation vs operational benefits
- 💡 Provide legally sound, forensic-ready incident response guidance
